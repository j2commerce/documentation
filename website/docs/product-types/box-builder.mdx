# Box Builder

## What is Box Builder?

The Box Builder product type lets you create "Build-A-Box" products where customers can choose items to fill a box of a specific size. Think of it like a custom gift box, snack pack, or sample set where your customer picks what goes inside!

### Example Uses

- Gift boxes (pick 6 chocolates)

- Sample packs (choose 4 skincare products)

- Subscription boxes (select 8 snacks)

- Party packs (pick 12 treats)

## How Customers Use Box Builder

### On Desktop

- The customer sees a grid of available products

- Clicks "Add" to put an item in their box

- A sidebar shows their box filling up (empty slots turn filled)

- Can add the same item multiple times

- Uses +/- buttons to adjust quantities

- When box is full, "Add to Cart" button becomes active

- Clicks "Add to Cart" to proceed

### On Mobile

- Customer sees product grid (2 columns)

- Taps "Add" to select items

- A floating bar at the bottom shows progress: "4/6 Selected"

- When full, bar turns into "Add to Cart" button

- Taps to add completed box to cart

## Understanding Inventory Options

### Box Level Inventory (Simpler)

- You track stock on the box product only

- **Example:** You have 50 "Pick 6" boxes available

- When someone buys a box, your count goes from 50 to 49

- The individual products inside don't need inventory tracking

**Best for:** Fixed quantity kits, pre-packaged offerings

### Item Level Inventory (More Control)

- You track stock on each product separately

- When someone adds Product A to their box, Product A's stock decreases

- If Product A runs out, it can't be selected anymore

- Other products remain available

**Best for:** When individual products are also sold separately

## Understanding Tax Options

### Box Level Tax (Simpler)

- One tax rate applies to the entire box price

- Uses the tax profile assigned to the box product

- **Example:** 10% tax on a $30 box = $3 tax

### Item Level Tax (More Precise)

- Each product's individual tax rate applies

- Useful when products have different tax rates

- **Example:** Food items at 0% + supplements at 10%

## Common Questions

**Q: Can customers choose the same item multiple times?**

A: Yes! If you have a "Pick 6 Chocolates" box and someone loves the caramel flavor, they can add 6 caramels.

**Q: What if a product runs out of stock?**

A: Depends on your Inventory Handling setting:

\- **Box Level:** Customers can still select any product until boxes run out

\- **Item Level:** Out-of-stock products become unavailable

**Q: Can the price change based on selections?**

A: No. Box Builder uses a fixed price. All selections cost the same total amount.

**Q: Can I use variable products (like different sizes)?**

A: No. Only simple, configurable, and downloadable products work with Box Builder. Variable products with variants cannot be used.

**Q: How do I see what customers picked?**

A: In the order details, you'll see each box with a list of the items selected and their quantities.

**Q: Can I require a minimum box fill?**

A: The box must be completely filled before adding to the cart. Customers cannot add a partially filled box.

## Troubleshooting

**1: "Add to Cart" button stays disabled**

- Check that customers have filled ALL box slots

- The button only activates when the box is complete

**2: Products aren't appearing in search**

Make sure the products:

- Are published and enabled in J2Commerce > Apps

- Are simple, configurable, or downloadable type

- Don't have options already attached

- Have stock available (if tracking inventory)

**3: Stock isn't reducing correctly**

Check your **Inventory Handling** setting in the plugin configuration:

- Box Level: Only box stock reduces

- Item Level: Individual product stocks reduce

**4\:Customers see wrong products**

- Review the products added in the Box Builder tab

- Check the **Product Order** setting

- Make sure unwanted products are removed

## Tips for Success

1\. **Add more products than slots** - Give customers choices! A 6-item box with 20 product options is more engaging than exactly 6 products.

2\. **Use clear product images** - Customers pick visually, so good photos help conversions.

3\. **Set sensible box sizes** - 4-8 items work well. Very large boxes (10-12) can overwhelm customers.

4\. **Price competitively** - Show value! A $30 box of 6 items feels better than 6 individual $6 items.

5\. **Enable per-item pricing display** - "$5 per item" helps customers understand the value.

6\. **Test on mobile** - Many customers shop on phones, so verify the experience works well.
