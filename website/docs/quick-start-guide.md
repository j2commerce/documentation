&#x20;**Creating a Product:**

Since J2Commerce uses the default Joomla articles as its products, it lets you use native content as product.

Go to Content > Articles > Add new article. Now, new article page will open.

Give the title of the product, add your description about the product in the content tab and choose the category in which you want to display the product.
