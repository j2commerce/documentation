# Product search module

Having hundreds of products? Wishing that your users get what they want easily? You could always help them with this search module.

This module facilitates the search of products in J2Commerce. When the name of the product is typed in this search box, the products that have a part or whole of the keywords typed will get displayed.

**I already have the Joomla! search box. Why would I add this module?**

Is that your question? Then here is the answer:

This search box serves more or less like the Joomla! search box but with few differences. While the Joomla! search box is capable of searching J2Commerce articles, there is one exception for its functionalities.

Joomla! search box will not be able to search products if the products list view is used to display the products but it is capable of finding those that are displayed using the article or category blog layout.

Whereas, J2Commerce search box is capable of picking products that are displayed using the products list view as well, thus overcoming the default Joomla! search box’s limitation.

J2Commerce search box will search the product’s title, SKU, and description.
