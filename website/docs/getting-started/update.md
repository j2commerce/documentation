# Update

## Adding license key <a href="#adding-license-key" id="adding-license-key"></a>

We provide a Download ID when you subscribe. You can find this Download ID in two places.

In the PDF invoice we have issued to you

In our website’s My Downloads section. Click on your profile on the top right corner, then click on "My Account" and you will see your "Download ID".

![Download Id](<../../assets/download id.webp>)

You should copy the Download ID and paste it in J2Commerce > Setup > Configuration > Update tab.

**NOTE:** If you have reset your password on our site, then a new download ID will be issued (due to security reasons and to prevent unauthorized access.) Please make sure that the Download ID is correct.

## Update <a href="#update" id="update"></a>

**Very Very Important:** Take a **FULL BACKUP** of your site before you update. We recommend using the **Akeeba Backup** (free backup extension for Joomla) to take a backup. DO NOT proceed to update without taking a backup.

Updating to the latest version J2Commerce can be updated with two different methods: installing the new version on top of the old one or using the Joomla Extensions Update feature.

## Updating directly <a href="#updating-directly" id="updating-directly"></a>

This is the failsafe approach, but the least convenient. Download the latest J2Commerce release from our Downloads section and save the ZIP file to your hard disk.

Important J2Commerce Pro users should download the PRO version. You can download the PRO version from our site’s My Account > My Downloads section

Log in to your site’s backend, click on Extensions Manager. Use the Browse… button to locate the ZIP file you downloaded, then click on Upload and Install.

## Updating via Extensions Manager <a href="#updating-via-extensions-manager" id="updating-via-extensions-manager"></a>

J2Commerce integrates nicely with the Extension Manager’s update feature. Whenever an update is available, you will see the update notification in your J2Commerce dashboard. Clicking on the update button will take you to the Extension Manager update section. There you can update to the Latest version.

## Updating from FREE to PRO version <a href="#updating-from-free-to-pro-version" id="updating-from-free-to-pro-version"></a>

There is a chance that you have used the FREE version to set up your store first. And you have subscribed to a plan to get the PRO version. In this case, you should download the PRO version from our My Downloads section and install it over the free version.

DO NOT **uninstall** the free version. Just install the PRO over the free version.

Updating from the free version to the PRO version will **NOT affect your store settings and data.**

J2Commerce uses the Joomla Extension Manager to provide updates to both the free and pro users. On a few occasions, you may not be able to access the updates via the Extensions Manager. You may get a 403 Access Denied when you try to update your site. It might be due to several reasons. We have listed a few that might cause this problem.

Make sure that the **Download ID** you have entered is correct.

## Firewall <a href="#firewall" id="firewall"></a>

If you make repeated attempts or requests, then our firewall might block access for a temporary period (usually 10 minutes).

In this case, please try again after 10 minutes.

If you still get the error, you can always download the latest version from our [My Downloads section](https://www.j2commerce.com/my-account) and install it via the Extensions manager.

## Timeout <a href="#timeout" id="timeout"></a>

J2Commerce uses the Joomla Extension Update tool. A time-out will occur if your connection is slow or if our server responds more slowly (which can sometimes occur if there are a huge number of download requests)

In this case, just try again after a few minutes. You will usually get through.
