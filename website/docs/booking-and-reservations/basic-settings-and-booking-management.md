# Basic settings and Booking Management

## Basic Settings <a href="#basic-settings" id="basic-settings"></a>

There are not many settings that have to be done to use this app. Here are a few parameters that are essential to start off with:

* Date format: Since you will be offering bookings and reservations, it is necessary that you specify the date format that you wish to use.
* Time format: Reservations and bookings will be based on time frames. Hence, it becomes mandatory to set the time format.
* Cart expiration time: This option would help manage the abandoned bookings. There might be situations where a user adds a booking to the cart but exceeds a specific time period without proceeding to the checkout process. Since the booking process is dynamic, this option would be of great help to avoid conflicts.

Setting the cart expiration minutes would make the items in the cart disappear after the specified time limit if the user does not proceed to the checkout process.
