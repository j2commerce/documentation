# Limitation of the booking products type

## Limitations of the booking product type <a href="#limitations-of-the-booking-product-type" id="limitations-of-the-booking-product-type"></a>

The following are the known limitations of the booking product:

* Though the booking product allows the store owners to set up fixed or pre-defined bookable time slots in terms of hours and minutes, the product doesnâ€™t support the store owners to allow users to choose the start and end hour (or minutes). That is, customer-defined blocks of hours and customer-defined blocks of minutes are not supported.

* Though you could set up person-type-based booking products, it is not possible to maintain or manage inventory based on the number of persons chosen by the user on the storefront.

## Instance <a href="#instance" id="instance"></a>

For example, the Person types allowed are as follows: 1) Adult, 2) Children

When a user books a particular time slot for 2 adults and 2 children, then this would not affect the Max bookings allowed per block.
