## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

In the booking product type, there is a tab on the left pane of the product article called the Persons tab, which might help you in setting up restrictions based on how many people can book the product.

This section also allows you to set up minimum and maximum restrictions on people who opt for booking the product. This is ideal when your store sells event tickets.

### Steps to be done <a href="#steps-to-be-done" id="steps-to-be-done"></a>

* Set the option Enable person to Yes.
* Set the minimum number to the minimum limit that you might want to set for the product.
* Set the maximum persons option to the maximum limit you might want to set for the product.
* If you wish to charge based on the number of persons, then set the option “Multiply block price by person count” to yes.
* When you wish to sell based on person types, then enable the option Enable person types.
* Once you have enabled the person types option, you will be provided with choices to create person types as per your requirements.
