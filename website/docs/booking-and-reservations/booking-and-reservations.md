# Booking and Reservations

Want to use your store as a ticket booking system?

Have you been wanting a solution to achieve this for a long time?

The wait is over. Here comes the app “Bookings and reservations” to meet your needs.

Transform your shopping cart into a ticket booking system by creating bookable products.

Sell date or time-based bookings and reservations, sell tickets, and more. Manage availability by date or time and whatnot?

Want to offer price differences based on person types? Now that is also possible.

Offer appointments, services, bookings or rentals in your Joomla website with J2Commerce.

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Our bookable product type allows you to set up bookable products for reservations, services, and rentals/hires. Bookings can be given customizable dates, cost, and duration, and can be purchased.

Here are the features that come in handy with the app:

## Flexible Booking slots <a href="#flexible-booking-slots" id="flexible-booking-slots"></a>

Create fixed or customer-defined booking slots. You can offer a block of dates or time slots for booking, or the customer can decide when to book your offerings.

## Bookable types <a href="#bookable-types" id="bookable-types"></a>

You can create bookable products based on date, time, a combination of date and time, or by month, customer-defined.

## Multi-person bookings <a href="#multi-person-bookings" id="multi-person-bookings"></a>

The customer can book for multiple persons. Example: 2 Adults and 3 Children. The pricing could be defined accordingly. You could offer a per-person discount as well.

## Availability <a href="#availability" id="availability"></a>

You can make only certain days or time slots available for booking. Example: A room could be booked only on August 24 and 25. The rest of the days or time slots would be unavailable for booking.

## Manage inventory <a href="#manage-inventory" id="manage-inventory"></a>

You can manage the bookable inventory in days or time slots. As soon as a bookable slot is full, it will not be available for customers to book.

## Booking multiple days <a href="#booking-multiple-days" id="booking-multiple-days"></a>

Let customers choose multiple days for booking a resource. Example: A car could be rented on September 20,21,22,23. The customer could choose all four days and book. The pricing could reflect his selection.

## Custom-tailored booking costs <a href="#custom-tailored-booking-costs" id="custom-tailored-booking-costs"></a>

You can define the cost of the booking made. Apart from the regular price of the product, every block could have an additional cost.

## Calendar views <a href="#calendar-views" id="calendar-views"></a>

Display the availability, booking slots in a calendar format to the customers. Highlight the availability.

## Seamless management of bookings <a href="#seamless-management-of-bookings" id="seamless-management-of-bookings"></a>

Manage the bookings on your site on the go with the app.
