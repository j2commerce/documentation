  Shipment Tracking—Unified: For cross-divisional tracking.

#### Additional considerations

**Existing DHL account:** You will need an active customer account with the relevant DHL business division (e.g., DHL Express) before obtaining a production API key

**Third-party integration:** If you are using a third-party application like an e-commerce platform, the process may involve selecting your platform when requesting credentials.
