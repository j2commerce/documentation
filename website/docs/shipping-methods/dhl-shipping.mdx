## **How to obtain UPS OAuth Credentials:**{#how-to-obtain-ups-oauth-credentials}

The following instructions will help walk you through the process of obtaining your new UPS OAuth Client ID and Client Secret.

**Step 1:** Go to [UPS.com](http://UPS.com) and log in.

**Step 2:** Click My Apps in the top right corner

**Step 3:** Click Add Apps in the bottom left corner



**Step 4:** Then, I need API credentials because I want to integrate UPS technology into my business.

**Step 5:** On the same page as #4: Select the client's UPS account you need to link it to



**Step 6:** Complete the contact info

**Step 7:** Then select the Rating, Tracking, and Time In Transit API's (I believe the Authorization(OAuth) is automatically added when you save)

(Right now, we aren't using the Tracking API, but we do plan on incorporating that in later versions, so better to add it now so you don't need to worry about adding it later...)



**Step 8:** After saving, you should be able to see the Client ID and client Secret under the App Info/Credentials page
