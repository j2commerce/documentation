**Step 2:** Create a new app and select an API

- Log in to the DHL Developer Portal

- Select the specific DHL API you wish to use from the API catalog, such as:

  DHL Global Forwarding APIs: For global ocean and air freight shipments.

  Shipment Tracking—Unified: For cross-divisional tracking.

- You will be notified by email once your request is approved. Log back into the portal to retrieve your production API key and secret

#### Additional considerations

**Existing DHL account:** You will need an active customer account with the relevant DHL business division (e.g., DHL Express) before obtaining a production API key

**Third-party integration:** If you are using a third-party application like an e-commerce platform, the process may involve selecting your platform when requesting credentials.
