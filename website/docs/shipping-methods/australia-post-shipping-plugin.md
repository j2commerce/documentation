- **Request API Access:**

  Once logged in, navigate to the section for requesting API access. This is typically found under "My Account" or similar, and you will need to select the specific APIs you wish to use (e.g., Shipping & Tracking, Postage Assessment, Address Validation).

- **Complete Registration Details:**

  Provide the necessary information, which may include your Australia Post (eParcel), StarTrack, or MyPost Business account number.

- **Await Approval:**

  Australia Post will review your request. If approved, they will enable your account for the requested APIs.Â 

- **Generate API Key and Secret (Password):**

  After approval, you will receive an invitation or instructions to generate your API key and secret.
