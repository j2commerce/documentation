J2Commerce offers you to set advanced pricing for your product. This functionality enables you to have prices based on the quantity and date range.

* After creating an article and product type under the J2Commerce (J2Store Cart) tab, select Save.
* Navigate to the J2Commerce (J2Store Cart) tab > Variants. If there is more than one variant, then open each specific variant that will receive special advanced pricing. Enter the regular price that you want the public to see.

### How to set up date range-based discounts: <a href="#how-to-set-up-date-range-based-discounts" id="how-to-set-up-date-range-based-discounts"></a>

If you are trying to set up date range-based discounts, you could do so by setting up advanced pricing as follows:

**Discount date range: 02-04-2019 to 16-04-2019 Regular price of the product: 20 Discounted price: 10**

Navigate to your product article > J2Commerce (J2Store Cart) tab > variants > open variants > pricing > Set Prices > mention the date range in the Date range (optional) field, set the discounted rate, and click Create.

So when users buy this product, within the above-mentioned date range, they would receive the discount mentioned.

### How to set up quantity-based discounts: <a href="#how-to-set-up-quantity-based-discounts" id="how-to-set-up-quantity-based-discounts"></a>

This option might be useful when you are trying to set up quantity range-based discounts on your products.

**Quantity range: 2 and above Regular price: 20 Discounted price: 10**

With the above setup, when the user buys 2 or more quantities of the given product, they would receive each quantity for 10$.

That is when users buy 5 quantities of the product, the total price would be

\_5\*\_10=50 instead of 5\*20=100

### How to set up customer group-based discounts: <a href="#how-to-setup-customer-group-based-discounts" id="how-to-setup-customer-group-based-discounts"></a>

When you wish to offer customer-group-based pricing, you could choose the customer groups in the customer group option and set the price accordingly.

**User group eligible for discount: wholesale Regular price: 20 Discounted price: 10**

So, with the above advanced pricing set up, users of the Wholesale group receive a discount on the product.

## Creating Advanced pricing: <a href="#creating-advanced-pricing" id="creating-advanced-pricing"></a>
