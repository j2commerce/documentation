## **Creating a new Article in a different Language**

Each product that you want to show up in a specific language must have a duplicate version in the primary language. Then they need to be attached. The steps below show you how to do that. In the first step, we will choose English as the main language, and then the matching product will be in German.

**Step 1:** Create a product article. Articles > New > Name it

**Step 2:** Content tab: Choose English as the language in the sidebar. If the Language category doesn't show up, it's most likely because you forgot to enable it in the previous steps.

**Step 3:** Save > Save & Copy. This will create a duplicate copy. Look at all of the tabs on the duplicate to make sure none of the information is missing

**Step 4:** Name the duplicate article the same name, but in the language of choice.  In this example, we are choosing German. &#x20;

**Step 5:** Choose English as the language in the sidebar

## Setting Up Multilingual Association:

The next step is linking the two products together.

**Step 1:** Go to the Primary language product you just created (ie: English).&#x20;

**Step 2:** Click in the Associations tab. Click on Select.

**Step 3:** Find the product you created in the secondary language (ie: German) and select it. Now both products are linked together.&#x20;

**Note:** *Articles that are labeled as "ALL" languages will not show up in the window. Only products with specific languages*

You will know that you did it correctly when you go to the Articles menu and see that the two are linked together.&#x20;
