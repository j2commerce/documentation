# Digifactu

Digifactu/Digifact is an electronic invoicing platform that lets businesses issue, manage, and store legally compliant electronic invoices. In markets such as Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, El Salvador, or the Dominican Republic, these systems help companies generate digital invoices that meet each country’s tax authority requirements, integrate with ERPs, automate workflows, and securely store records. &#x20;

Each Country has its own Digifactu name. ie: **Spain**'s Invoicing Landscape  is called **(Veri\*factu)**

**Sync Order Status:** Select which order statuses should trigger invoice synchronization to DigiFactu.

**Submitted Order Status:** Orders that are successfully submitted into the Digifactu system will have their order status changed to the selected order status.

***\*\*Note: How to add a new Order Status to the drop-down menu:*** *Open a new tab and go to your J2Commerce > Localization > Order Statuses > New. Once you have created a new status, go back to your app and hit save to refresh it, and it will appear in the drop-down menu. See image below.*

**Sync Zero Total Orders:** Should orders with zero total be synchronized to DigiFactu?

**Enable Manual Sync Button:** Show a manual sync button on individual order pages in the admin view. This is shown on the orders with matching order status to the Sync Order Status field.

The image below shows what the manual sync button looks like in the order status page if the button has been enabled to Yes. Once the order has been pushed through to DigiFactu, the order status will automatically change from Confirmed to Submitted (or whatever status you assigned it)

## Manage Billing Series tab

![](/img/digifactu-billing.webp)

A billing series is a structured sequence of invoice numbers that share the same prefix/format and sequencing rules. For example, you might create separate billing series for different product lines or regions, like:

- `INV-2025-US-001, INV-2025-US-002…`

- `SERV-2025-EU-001, SERV-2025-EU-002…`

This helps with **organization, legal tracking, and consistent numbering** of invoices and bills.  The configuration of different invoicing series, payment methods, and VAT types is managed in this section. Here, for example, the colors of each series can be adjusted, which will be reflected in the various generated documents, not only invoices but also Delivery Notes, etc.

## Manage Queue tab

Here you will find the list of invoices that are waiting to be processed by the system.  You can either wait for DigiFactu to push them through, or you can do it manually in the individual order by clicking the sync button
