The next step shows how to assign a newsletter to a product. Now, when someone purchases this specific product, they will receive newsletters regarding that product. In the example below, we are assigning the Simple Product Newsletters to the Simple Product.

**Step 9:** Open the product in articles > J2Commerce (J2Store Cart) > Apps > Click on all of the newsletters you want to be available for the simple product.  You can also enable the "Auto Subscription", which will show up on the front end during checkout, allowing the customer to opt in/out of the newsletters.
