# Donation

The app adds donation as a product option, allowing the store owners to collect donation in addition to selling their products.

The customer will be able to enter the amount of the donation in a text box. You give the liberty of choosing the amount to your user.

The app seamlessly integrates with J2Commerce. You will be able to create a donation option type and associate it with the product. No complex configuration is required to use this app. Just install the plugin over your site, start creating option and add it to as many products as you like.\\

## **Limitations:**

When using the donation option type, avoid using another option with a price modifier (_**like a select or radio type option that adds / modifies the price**_)
