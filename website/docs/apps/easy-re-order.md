## Setting up the Parameters

The app places a button on the My Profile page, allowing users to re-order the items of a previous or existing order in a few clicks.

Select the page that the customer should be redirected to after clicking on the Re-Order button displayed next to the order placed by the customer at the My Profile page.

Now, when the customer has placed an order for a product and wants to re-order the same product, they visit the My profile page and click on the "Re-order" button to be directed to either the Cart page or Checkout page (Based on the redirect option you set at the store backend) and then complete placing the order further from there.
