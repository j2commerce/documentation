# Ask question / quote

This app allows customer to enquire a product or to ask quote for a product through email.

Using this app itself you can use your store as catalog mode since this app has an option to hide the add to cart button. Clicking on single button will enable the communication between store owner and customer.

**Requirements**

* PHP 8.1.0 +
* Joomla! 4.x/ Joomla! 5.x +
* J2Commerce / J2Store 4.x +

**Switch off catalog mode:**

**NOTE:** **If you are having the shop in catalog mode, the ask quote button wouldnâ€™t come up on the storefront.**

Alternatively, you could turn off the catalog mode and hide the add to cart buttons in the site using the **Hide add to cart button for all products?** in the basic settings of the Ask Quote plugin.
