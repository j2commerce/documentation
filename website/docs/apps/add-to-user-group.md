## Creating Unique User Groups

Once you have enabled the app, you can create as many unique groups as you need so you can organize your customers.  This will be very helpful when wanting to send a specific group of customers marketing material, promotions, new products, etc.&#x20;

For example, if your customer is buying a digital product, you can add them to a special digital group, or if they are an important shopper, you can add them to a VIP shopper group and give them special access to certain products or documents.

### Create New User Groups

Go to Users > groups > New. Now name it whatever you want.&#x20;

In this example, we have named it VIP Shoppers.&#x20;
