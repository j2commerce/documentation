**File Name Prefix:** The value provided will be used as the file name prefix. Example: Invoice.

**Send PDF Invoice for Status:** The PDF will be attached and sent only when the status of the order is among the chosen values here.  In the example above, the PDF Invoice will only appear after the order has been paid and "Confirmed".

**Additional Files:** You can send more files along with the PDF Invoice. First, upload additional PDF files to the `media/j2store` folder and choose the files here.

**Attach Invoice To:** You can select to whom you want to attach the invoice with the email.

**Enable Tidy Repair:** Set 'Yes' if you want to clean and fix malformed HTML strings via the Tidy PHP extension (`ext-tidy` must be installed and enabled on the server.

**Enable HTML5 Parser:** Set 'Yes' to check the integrity of the HTML code. The parser is a tool that checks that the underlying HTML code is correct. For instance, there is no missing \</p> tag after a \<p> tag

**Font Family CSS:** To enter the CSS font family property, add: `font-family: Helvetica; `Press F10 to toggle Full Screen editing.

**Custom CSS:** Add any custom CSS rules to further customize the appearance of the PDF invoice. Example: `table { border-color: #000; } `

**Show Link in Frontend:** Set 'yes' if you want the customer to be able to download the PDF invoice in the order history page of their profile

## Frontend View of Orders

The image below shows an example of how the download button will appear on the frontend if you set the "Show Link In Frontend" to Yes.

Once you have set up the app, you will now see it in the order confirmation page.  The example above shows the Download button appearing once the order status has been "confirmed" because that is what we set it as in the app settings section.
