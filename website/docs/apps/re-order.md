## Configuration:

Once you have enabled the Re-Order App under J2Commerce > Apps, the app places a button on the My Profile page, allowing users to re-order the items of an existing order in a few clicks.

Now, click on "Open" under J2Commerce > Apps > Re-Order, and configure the App.

Select the page that the customer should be redirected to post clicking on the Re-Order button displayed next to the order placed by the customer at the My Profile page.

Now when the customer has placed order for a product and want to re-order the same product they visit the My profile page and click on the "Re-order" button to be directed to either the Cart page or Checkout page (Based on redirect option you set at store backend) and then complete placing the order further from there.
