### Basic tab

**Shipping Restriction Mode:**&#x20;

The extension offers two modes of operation. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

- **Simple Mode:** (Recommended for Most Users)

Best for stores that need basic shipping method restrictions on a per-product basis.

**How it works:** You select which shipping methods are allowed for each product directly on the product edit page.

- **Advanced Mode:**

Best for stores with complex shipping requirements involving geographic restrictions, zip code limitations, and user group restrictions.

**How it works:** You create "Restriction Groups" that combine multiple rules, then assign these groups to products.

### &#x20;Simple Mode tab

![](/img/restrictions-simple.webp)

When using Simple mode, you'll see these additional options:

**If the allowed shipping methods for items in an order are not available, then:** Choose what happens when a product has no shipping restrictions set: \<br>- *Don't display any shipping method* - No shipping options shown\<br>- *Display all available shipping methods* - Show all options

**When multiple methods are available for items in an order, do you want to force allow only one shipping method?**: When multiple methods are available, force a single specific method. Sometimes, you may want to allow only one method if that was the restricted shipping option for a product. In those cases you can choose to force.

**If you want to force, which method**: Select the shipping method to force when the above is enabled. ***NOTE:*** This would apply only if the selected method is available for at least one product in the order. If this was not an available shipping option for any of the products in the cart/order, then no forcing will be implemented. Available shipping options would be shown

**Allowed common shipping method**: Selected shipping method if available, it will show in shipping. The shipping method that will always be available regardless of product restrictions

### Advanced Mode tab:

![](/img/restrictions-advanced.webp)

When using Advanced mode, you'll see:

&#x20;**Display Restricted Message**: Choose where to show restriction warnings:\<br>- *Do Not Display*\<br>- *Product View Only*\<br>- *Category View Only*\<br>- *Product & Category Views*

The following section is for you if you chose the Simple mode in the App.  See the image below.

**Note:** If you choose the Simple Mode, it will show up on the App tab of the product page (as shown below.  You cannot use Simple Mode for products that have Variants. You have to switch it to Advanced Mode for Variant products.

## How Restrictions Work at Checkout

### Simple Mode Behavior

**When a customer reaches checkout:**

\- Only shipping methods that are allowed for ALL products in the cart will be displayed

\- If no common shipping methods exist, the behavior depends on your "If no allowed shipping methods" setting

### Advanced Mode Behavior

**When a customer reaches checkout:**

\- The system checks if the shipping address matches any restricted geo zones or zip codes

\- If a restricted product is in the cart AND the shipping address matches the restriction:

&#x20; \- All shipping methods are hidden

&#x20; \- A warning message is displayed listing the restricted products

&#x20; \- The customer must remove restricted items to continue checkout

### Warning Messages

If configured to display restriction messages:

**On Product Pages:**

\> "Restricted from shipping in: \[Zone Names]"

**On Category Pages:**

A "Restricted Product" badge appears with a tooltip showing restricted zones.

**At Checkout:**

\> "Your cart contains an item that has been restricted from selling in your local region. Please remove it from your order to continue the checkout process."

## Managing Restriction Groups

### View All Restrictions

1\. Go to **Components > J2Store > Apps > Product Shipping Restrictions**

2\. Click the **Restrictions** toolbar button

3\. You'll see a list of all restriction groups with their status

### Edit a Restriction

1\. Click on the restriction ID or name in the list

2\. Make your changes

3\. Click **Save Restriction**

### Enable/Disable a Restriction

Click the status icon (green checkmark or red X) in the restriction list to toggle the status.

### Best Practices

1\. **Start with Simple Mode** if you only need to limit shipping methods per product

2\. **Use descriptive names** for restriction groups (e.g., "Hazmat - Ground Only" instead of "Restriction 1")

3\. **Test thoroughly** by placing test orders from different locations

4\. **Use the Note field** to document why a restriction exists

5\. **Set up Geo Zones first** in J2Store > Localization > Geozones before creating advanced restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### Shipping methods not showing

\- Check that the product has shipping enabled

\- Verify the shipping method itself is enabled and configured

\- Ensure the "If no allowed shipping methods" setting matches your expectations

### Restriction not applying

\- Confirm the restriction group is set to "Enabled"

\- Check that the geo zone includes the correct countries/zones

\- Verify the restriction is assigned to the correct product or category

### All shipping methods showing despite restrictions

\- Make sure you're in the correct mode (Simple vs Advanced)

\- For Simple mode, ensure you selected specific methods (not "All")

\- For Advanced mode, verify the customer's address matches the restricted zone
