# Introduction to Partial payments

This app can help you and the users in case of products with higher costs. As the name suggests, partial payments allow users to pay in installments. In this case, to meet your customersâ€™ needs, you might offer them the possibility to leave a deposit and make the full payment later. This kind of feature is now possible with our **Partial Payments** app. There is an added advantage since the users get to choose if they want to pay the full amount or in segments.

Customers pay either a fixed price or by percentage up front. You could also set up plans defining how the user can pay the amount. Sounds Great?

Here are the numerous features that come in handy with this app:

* Store admins can enable partial payment globally or at the per-product level.
* Three types of partial payment: Fixed price, percentage, and plans.
* Different types of partial payment plans can be created and added to the products.
* Force customers to pay the remaining amount after a specific days from the day on which the initial payment was made.

* Notify about pending payment to customer through email on the days after the payment date.
