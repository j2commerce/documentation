NOTE: The API username, password and the signature are optional fields. These fields are required only when you use the subscription app or when you have an issue with receiving the IPN callbacks from Paypal. If you are using a personal account, then you can just fill in your PayPal Merchant Email (of your personal account) and start using the plugin. It is not necessary to fill-in the API Keys.

\*\*Check Paypal credentials: \*\*

Click on this to check whether the enter credentials are accurate.

Choose the callback url to be used for IPN notifications

The URL selected here will be set as dynamic IPN url instead of the URL which you have configured in your PayPal account.

* Default url : The default url is the normal query string url used for IPN Notifications. This will work for 99% of the users. If it does not work in some cases, you could try any one of the following alternative urls.http(s)://www.example.com/index.php?option=com\_\_j2store\&view=checkout\&task=confirmPayment\&orderpayment\_type=payment\_paypal\&paction=process
* Alternative - 1 : It is the alternative callback url that uses the callback view.http(s)://www.example.com/index.php?option=com\_\_j2store\&view=callback\&method=payment\_paypal\&paction=process
* Alternative - 2 : It is the Proxy of default url. Sometimes, the PayPal IPN server truncates the query strings. It happens very rarely and you can check the IPN history in your PayPal account to see if PayPal is truncating. Login to your PayPal account and then go to: to view the IPN history. If it does truncates the query strings, you can use this url http(s)://www.example.com/plugins/j2store/payment\_paypal/payment\_paypal/tmpl/notify.php

If you are using any firewall like Admin Tools PRO, you might have to add exception to IPN url you have selected to use. PayPal does a server-to-server remote post. Most firewalls will block remote post requests.

**Validate IPN:** Customers can receive instant payment notification whenever a payment is made.
