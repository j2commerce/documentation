# Cash on Delivery

This, as everyone knows, paying at the time of purchase, in cash. This can be either at the product outlet or at customerâ€™s home or office, where the delivery is made. For cash transactions, a surcharge will be collected and it may be a fixed value (e.g., $ 20.00) or a percentage of the total bill amount (e.g., 0.02%).
