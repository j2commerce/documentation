# Usecases

The following use cases will explain briefly to you how to set up subscription products based on auto-renewal payments, manual renewal, one-time subscription, etc

## 1. Accepting recurring payments in Joomla! <a href="#id-1-accepting-recurring-payments-in-joomla" id="id-1-accepting-recurring-payments-in-joomla"></a>

Recurring payments are transactions that occur on a repetitive basis, such as a subscription service where payments are charged for a pre-determined duration of time.

For example, now we are going to create a subscription product “GlossyBox” which allows auto-renewal payments for every 3rd month. Follow the instructions given below to set up the renewal subscription product:

* Go to Content > Article Manager and create a 'New' article
* Move to the J2Commerce (J2Store cart) tab and choose 'YES' to treat as a product and choose product type Simple subscription.
* Under the 'General' tab, select 'YES' to storefront visible.
* Then, navigate to the 'Pricing' tab.
* Enter the subscription price, choose every 3rd from the first drop-down list, and then choose Month from the second drop-down list.
* Choose Never Expire for the Subscription length.
* Save.

## 2. Selling one-time subscriptions with manual renewals <a href="#id-2-selling-one-time-subscriptions-with-manual-renewals" id="id-2-selling-one-time-subscriptions-with-manual-renewals"></a>

A Non-Recurring Charge is a one-time invoice, whether an admin manually creates it or someone registers online.

For example, now we are going to create a subscription product, “Reward Box”. The duration of this subscription product is only one month. At the end of one month, the subscriber has to manually renew his / her subscription if they wish to continue receiving a reward box from the store. Follow the instructions given below to set up the non-renewal subscription product:

* Go to Content > Article Manager and create a new article
* Move to the J2Commerce (J2Store cart) tab and choose 'YES' to treat as a product and choose product type Simple subscription.
* Under the 'General' tab, select 'YES' to storefront visible.
* Then, navigate to the 'Pricing' tab
* Enter the subscription price, choose every from the first dropdown list, and then choose Month from the second dropdown list.
* Choose 1 Month for the SUbscription length.
* Save.

## 3. Selling subscriptions on a monthly or yearly basis on your Joomla website <a href="#id-3-selling-subscriptions-on-a-monthly-or-yearly-basis-in-your-joomla-website" id="id-3-selling-subscriptions-on-a-monthly-or-yearly-basis-in-your-joomla-website"></a>

Allow your customer to choose either a monthly or a yearly subscription service. This is possible by creating a product with a type variable subscription product.

For example, now we are going to create a variable subscription product, “Love and care book crate”. The customer can subscribe to this service either on a monthly or yearly basis. Follow the instructions given below to set up the renewal subscription product:

* Go to Components > J2Commerce > Catalog > Options
* Create a new option named “Subscription period” and add option values 6 months and 1 year.
* Save.
* Now go to Content > Article Manager and create a 'new' product with type Variable subscription.
* Then, move to the J2Commerce (J2Store cart) tab and navigate to the variants tab. Add the option and generate the variants.
* Now, set up the duration and price for each variant.
* Save.

## 4. Selling memberships on your Joomla website <a href="#id-4-selling-memberships-in-your-joomla-website" id="id-4-selling-memberships-in-your-joomla-website"></a>

Let's consider that you are selling online courses. While selling online courses, you may want users to limit their access to the whole site. This can be possible by providing membership. For example, set up membership like free, professional, and Gold.

Subscribing for Free allows users to access only specific courses.

Subscribing to the membership plan “Professional” allows users to access all courses available on the site for a specific period of time. And customer support will be available.

Subscribing to the membership plan “Gold” allows customers to access all courses, video tutorials, and several online tests.

Let's watch the video here to learn how to create membership plans:
