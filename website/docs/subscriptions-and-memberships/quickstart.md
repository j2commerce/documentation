# Quickstart

A recurring subscription is nothing but auto-renewal. J2Commerceâ€™s Subscriptions and Memberships app allows you to create recurring subscriptions. If you create a recurring subscription, the customers can auto-renew their subscription plan.

## Example <a href="#example" id="example"></a>

The example given below assumes you have a store that sells hosting services and wants to collect $99 at the end of every 6th month.

### Step 1: Creating a product <a href="#step---1-creating-product" id="step---1-creating-product"></a>

* Go to the Article Manager and create a new article
* Move to the J2Commerce (J2Store cart) tab
* Select 'YES' to treat asa  product
* Choose product type, either Simple Subscription or Variable Subscription.

## How to create a non-recurring (one-term) subscription plan? <a href="#how-to-create-a-non-recurring-one-term-subscription-plan" id="how-to-create-a-non-recurring-one-term-subscription-plan"></a>

Non-recurring is a single-term subscription in which the subscription will be terminated at a specific period and does not allow for auto-renewal. The subscriber will have to subscribe to the plan next time manually.

Let's see an example for a single-term subscription. For example, consider that you are providing service for $129 for one year.
